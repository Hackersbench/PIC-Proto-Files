# PIC-8-Proto

The modular nature of my HackaDay Prize entry suggests that I will be building a lot of small PIC based circuits. For quite a while I was a huge fan of the tiny PIC Proto board produced by TAUTIC Electronics. Unfortunately they are not available any more so I decided to design my own. The board will accept any 6 or 8 pin PIC microcontroller. It has a header to connect a PIC KIT 3 or 4 for programming, and provides space for an MCP1700 series LDO voltage regulator.

The PCB was created using DipTrace. The board art file is included in this repository, and a free version of DipTrace may be downloaded from:  https://diptrace.com/download/download-diptrace/#DownloadForm/1/
